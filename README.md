About:
------------------------------------------------------
TestREx is a testbed for repeatable exploits, which has as main features: 
* packing and running applications with their environments; 
* injecting exploits and monitoring their success; and
* generating security reports. 

We also provide a several example applications (wordpress 3.2, nodegoat and a couple of 
simple apps that demonstrate vulnerabilities for node.js).


Quick installation instructions (tested on Ubuntu 16.04)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Run the 'scripts/install.sh' script (reboot/log out if necessary)

2. Build the base software containers by running:
    sudo python [TestREx root folder]/util/build-base-images.py
